Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in, tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align
Will heaven step in will it save us from our sin, will it?
‘Cause this house of mine stands strong

That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey

And you're standing on the edge face up
‘Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
