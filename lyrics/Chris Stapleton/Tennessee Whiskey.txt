Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone

You're as smooth
As Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet
As strawberry wine
You're as warm
As a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love
All the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
...
