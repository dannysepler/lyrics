Oooh, yeah, yeah
I put my feelings on safety
So I don't go shootin' where your heart be
'Cause you take the bullet tryna save me
Then I'm left to deal with makin' you bleed

And that's a whole lotta love, ain't tryna waste it
Like we be runnin' 'em out and never make it
That's just too bitter for words, don't wanna taste it
That's just too bitter for words, don't wanna face it

But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin'
I've been sippin', that's how I control
This feelin', you keep givin'
You keep on hittin' it ooh, oh
Maybe it's your love, it's too good to be true
Baby boy, your love, got me trippin' on you
You know your love is big enough, make me trip up on you
Yeah, it's big enough, got me trippin' on you, trip-trippin' on you

My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (trippin' on you)
My bad, my bad for, trippin' on you (trippin' on you)
