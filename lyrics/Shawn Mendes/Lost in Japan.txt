All it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I

I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask

Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight

â€˜Cause I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

I can feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah

Do I gotta convince you that you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
...
