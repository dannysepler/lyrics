I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
...
