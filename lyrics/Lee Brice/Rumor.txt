Girl you know I've known you forever
How many nights we hung out together
Same little crowd, little bar, little town
Round this old dance floor
My boys are laughin' and tap me on the shoulder
Making a motion like "'Could y'all get any closer?"
They wanna know what's up when I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

There's a rumor going round about me and you
Stirring up our little town the last week or two
So tell me why we even trying to deny this feeling
I feel, don't you feel it too?
There's a rumor going round, and round, and round
What d'you say we make it true?
We make it true
