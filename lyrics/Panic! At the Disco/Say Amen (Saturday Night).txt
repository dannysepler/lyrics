Been traveling in packs that I can't carry anymore
Waiting for somebody else to carry me
There's nothing that's left for me at my door
All the people I know aren't who they used to be
And if I try to change my life for one day
There would be nobody else to save
And I can't change into a person I don't wanna be
So, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah

I pray for the wicked on the weekend
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
Swear to God, I ain't ever gonna repent
Mama, can I get another amen?
Oh, oh, it's Saturday night, yeah
