I got it good girl
‘Cause I got myself a good girl
Yeah you up and took my whole world
And made it so good girl

You're an angel
You're a keeper
The kinda thing that you gotta lock down
I'm lovin' just livin'
Every minute since you came around

I was lost in the neon lights
‘Til the day that you called me yours
Yeah and they say when you know, you know
And I know one thing's for sure

I got it good girl
‘Cause I got myself a good girl
I still can't believe I found you
Can't imagine life without you

I could take you home to mama
Take you to the church right down the street
Yeah you up and took my whole world
...
