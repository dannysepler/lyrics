I'm just flesh and bone
Heart and soul, and I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kinda thing
Slide right outta my arms
I struck out, I've been knocked down

More times than I can count
But that don't matter now
Cause when you smile I see the sun sink down
On a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you

I'm not the man I was before ya
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect
Oh cause girl you know I'm not
But I love you, with everything I got
Girl I'll give you my best shot

You saw a spark inside of me
...
