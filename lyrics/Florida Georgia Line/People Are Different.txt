White collar, blue collar, hillbilly, high dollar
Hot head, pot head, non-believer, holy water
Big city, small town, y'all take a look around
People are different

Heavy metal, hip hop, steal toe, flip flops
Sip it slow, cold beer, hits you fast, whiskey shot
Accent North, South, good as gold, sailor mouth
People are different

Yeah, we all know it's true
But it don't mean that me and you

Can't walk down a street
And smile at a stranger
Heart on your sleeve
And love thy neighbor
No matter what shape
No matter what color
Break bread instead of fighting each other

Slip on a pair of another man's shoes
You'll see by the time you get back
This old world would be a whole lot better place
