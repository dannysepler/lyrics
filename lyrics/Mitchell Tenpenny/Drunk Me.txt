Some people don't know when to quit
And that's why they quit
Some need to hit the bottom, to see they got a problem
They can't handle it

But, that ain't why I
Started cleaning up my life
Wish it was, but
Oh, that would be a lie

I've been sober
'Cause there ain't no hangover like you, girl
No, no, no

Baby, can you come over?
I always find those words at the bottom of a hundred proof, yeah
Girl, every time you do

I just stand up, head all messed up
Like the sheets, where we made love
I've been sober since you've broke my heart in two
'Cause drunk me, can't get over you

There ain't no hangover, like you
...
