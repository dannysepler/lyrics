Uh
Yeah
Oh, that's London On Da Track, run that shit back
We got London On Da Track

Swervin'
How you look so perfect on your worst days?
Double C your purses, you deserve it
Niggas in your DM, they be thirsty (Thirsty)
And in person
But you're curvin'
Curvy little body, love your surface (Surface)
Yeah, I'm all on your body, make you nervous
I like the way you keep up with your earnings
Yeah, it's okay, 'cause you swervin'

I fuck you from the back and leave you turnin' (Turnin')
The type to make you feel like I'm so worth it (Worth it)
Blame my ex, that bitch, she did me dirty (Did me dirty)
Had me fall in love and then she curved me
(On God, swear to God, I don't wanna leave you, no)
New Louboutin, you would think
I'm bleedin' from my toes
Dick all inside of you
Make you freeze, make you pose
I want you to get up on your knees and your toes
I see one of my enemies
They gon' freeze like they cold
I swear I ain't no killer, but test me if you want
You don't want my adrenaline rushin'
Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
So much shit up on my mind
I can't think, yeah
