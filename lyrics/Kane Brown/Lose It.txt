Yeahh yeah
That little ringin' buzzin' good for nothin' phone in your hands
The directions to the party that's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station
Let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight

'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me, you got
My heart skip-skippin' a beat tonight
Close enough 'til there's no space between

You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind

Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
...
