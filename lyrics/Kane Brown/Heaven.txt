Hmmm, this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if i tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be

Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lyin' next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced
Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
...
