Yeah
(Wheezy outta here)
G, G

Back home, smokin' legal (Legal)
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit runnin' on diesel, dawg
Playin' with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg
(Who you see, what?)
Don Corleone
Trust me, at the top it isn't lonely (Strapped)
Everybody actin' like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're down, you gotta show me
(What you gotta do?)
Bring the clip back empty (It's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg
(Sent me, dawg)
I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg
(10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall
Doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
...
