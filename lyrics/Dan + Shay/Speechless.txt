You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume
Is floatin' down the stairs
You're fixin' up your hair like you do

I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time, It's nothin' new

It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
I'm speechless

Starin' at you, standin' there, in that dress
What it's doin' to me, ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
