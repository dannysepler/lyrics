Some days, things just take way too much of my energy
I look up and the whole room's spinning
You take my cares away
I guess I over complicate, people tell me to medicate

Feel my blood running, swear the sky's falling
I know that all this shit's fabricated
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
I know I gotta keep, keep on breathing
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'
I know I gotta keep, keep on breathing
