Right now I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
So I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up

I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up
I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
I'm lovin', I'm livin', I'm pickin' it up

I'm pickin' it up, pickin' it up
Lovin', I'm livin', so we turnin' up
Yeah, we turnin' it up

Ain't got no tears in my body
I ran out, but boy, I like it, I like it, I like it
Don't matter how, what, when, who tries it
We're out here vibin', we vibin', we vibin'

(Comin' out)
Even when it's rainin' down
(Can't stop now)
Can't stop so shut your mouth
(Shut your mouth)
And if you don't know then now you know it, babe
Know it, babe, yeah

Right now I'm in a state of mind
I wanna be in, like, all the time
Ain't got no tears left to cry
