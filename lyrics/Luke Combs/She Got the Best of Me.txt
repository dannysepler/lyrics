Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like Kerosene dancin' around a fire
But you're in it

So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all
She got the best of me

She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beatin' in this guitar
Every night, a different town

She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah you get what's left of me
...
