Her day starts with a coffee
And ends with a wine
Takes forever to get ready
So she's never on time for anything

When she gets that come get me look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me
The way that she drives me wild
And she drives me wild

Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
...
