This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart

I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken

Mmm, well nothing, nothing, nothing gon' save us now

Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark
(Crash in the dark)
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar
(Spin 'round in the bar)
...
