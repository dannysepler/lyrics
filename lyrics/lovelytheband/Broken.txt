I like that you're broken, broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you're lonely, lonely like me
I could be lonely with you

I met you late night, at a party
Some trust fund baby's Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let's talk
But my confidence is wearing off
Well these aren't my people
These aren't my friends
She grabbed my face and that's when she said

I like that you're broken, broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
...
