Well, baby love's just one of those words that gets thrown around
Like Jack and Coke, sitting on the bar when it gets watered down
So I ain't gonna say it, oh but I ain't gonna lie
If you wanna know the truth how I feel about you tonight

If you were my last breath, I'd just wanna hold you
If you were my last night of hell on wheels
I'd wanna drive you like I stole ya
If you were my last shot, last shot of whiskey (last shot of whiskey)
I'd press you to my lips, take a little sip
Swirl you around and around and around
Then I'd shoot you down
