Way up in the mountains, four thousand feet high
There's a trail through the trees to a cliff
Where Carolina meets the sky
Oh, and there's a view I just can't describe
No, I'm not there yet, just a few more steps, baby wait
Okay, you can open your eyes

This is it, this is now, this is what I've been talkin' â€˜bout
Lookin' out, can't you see forever
You take my hand, just take it in
This is a moment we won't forget
On top of the world, here, together
If there ever was a time for a perfect kiss, this is it
