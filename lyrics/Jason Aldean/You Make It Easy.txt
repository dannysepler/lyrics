Like a rainy Sunday mornin' makes me
Wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs

Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me
You make it easy, lovin' up on you

Make it easy, with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my saving grace
...
