Pour me, pour me another drink
Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more hell no, I just wanna
sip it til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line'em up and knock'em down
two more let's go, cause I ain't never
hurt like this before

Don't wanna think about her, or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar can't sing without her

So make them drinks strong, cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma need some whiskey glasses

Cause I don't wanna see the truth

She's probly makin' out on the couch right now with someone new
Yea I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
...
