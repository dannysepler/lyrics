Even though we both know we're liars
And we start each others fires
We just know that we'll be alright
Even though we're kicked out the party
'Cause we both hate everybody
We're the ones they wanna be like

So don't let me down
Keep me in trouble
Born to be wild
Out in the jungle

And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
Close to me
And if it wasn't you, I wouldn't want anybody
Close to me (yeah, yeah)
'Cause I'm an animal, animal-al
Like animal, like you
And I don't wanna be somebody without your body
...
