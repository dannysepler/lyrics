Sun is down, freezing cold
That's how we already know winter's here
My dawg would probably doing it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know he don't know nothing else
I tried to show him, yeah
I tried to show him, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young LaFlame yeah he's in sicko mode

Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hop in our coupes
This shit way too big,
when we pull up give me the loot (give me the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had to Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four all on lockdown, we make no moves
Now it's 4AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in Chase B mixes pop like Jamba juice
Different colored chains, see my jeweler really selling fruits
And they joking, man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Playing for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Playing for keeps, don't play us for weak

This shit way too formal, ya'll know I don't follow suit
Stacy Dash, most these of girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the booch
Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
