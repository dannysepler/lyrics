That Arizona sky burning in your eyes
You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find
So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye, baby, it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way
Lovers in the night
Poets trying to write
...
