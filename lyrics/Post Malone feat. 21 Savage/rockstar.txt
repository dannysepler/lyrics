Hahahahaha
Thank God
Ayy, ayy

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta 
(Ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin': Rest in peace to Bon Scott (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison ('son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
