D.A. got that dope!

Ice water, turned Atlantic (Freeze)
Nightcrawling in the Phantom (Skrrt, skrrt)
Told them hoes that don't you panic
Took an island, flood the mansion
(Yeah, big water)
Dropped the roof, more expansion
Drive a coupe you can stand in (It's lit)
See the bitches undercover (In the sheets)
I'm an ass and titties lover (Big ass)
Guess we all made for each other
Now that all the dawgs free (Yeah, yeah)
And we out in these streets (Alright)
Can you do it, can you pop it for me?

Pull up in a demon, on God (On God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (Fraud)
Flyin' private jet with the rod (Rod)
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (This that Z shit)
Pull up in a demon, on God (On God)
Lookin' like I still do fraud (Fraud)
Flyin' private jet with the rod (Rod)
This that Z shit, this that Z shit (This that Z shit)

Offset! Blow the brains out the coupe (Boo)
Police wanna talk, but I'm on mute (Woo, woo, hey)
I'ma bust her wrist down 'cause she cute (Ice)
Fuck her on a yacht, dive in a pool (Yeah)
She an addict (Addict),
Addict for the lifestyle and the Patek (Patek)
Big daddy, have you ever felt Chanel fabrics? (Chanel)
I be drippin' to death, I need a casket (Drippin')
And we got more stripes than the ref, he foul, TEC him (Bow, stripes)
