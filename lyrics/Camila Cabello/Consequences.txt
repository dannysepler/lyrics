Dirty tissues, trust issues
Glasses on the sink, they didn't fix you
Lonely pillows in a stranger's bed
Little voices in my head

Secret keeping, stop the bleeding
Lost a little weight because I wasn't eating
All the souls that I can't listen to,
To tell the truth

Loving you was young, and wild, and free
Loving you was cool, and hot, and sweet
Loving you was sunshine, safe and sound
...
