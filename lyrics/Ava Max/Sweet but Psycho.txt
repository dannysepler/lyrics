Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out ma mind"

Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out ma mind"

She'll make you curse, but she a blessing
She'll rip your shirt within a second
You'll be coming back, back for seconds
With your plate, you just can't help it

No, no, you'll play along
Let her lead you on, on, on
You'll be saying, "No, no"
Then saying, "Yes, yes, yes"
'Cause she messin' with your head

Oh, she's sweet but a psycho
A little bit psycho
At night she screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out ma mind"

Oh, she's hot but a psycho
So left but she's right though
At night she screamin'
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out ma mind"
