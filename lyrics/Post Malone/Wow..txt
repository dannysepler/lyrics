Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil' Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the Vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin' up (up, up)
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning (mm-mm)
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' (more forgivin')
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' (see me)
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin' (I be grinnin'), yeah

Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" (wow, wow)
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me (on me)
