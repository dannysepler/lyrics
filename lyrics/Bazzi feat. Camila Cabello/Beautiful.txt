Hey
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful angel
Love your imperfections every angle
Tomorrow comes and goes before you know
So I just had to let you know

The way that Gucci look on you, amazin'
But nothin' can compare to when you're naked
Now a Backwood and some Henny got you faded
You're sayin' you're the one for me, I need to face it

Started when we were younger
Swear to God that I loved her
Sorry that your mum found out

Guess that we just really had the thunder
Ain't nobody else that I'd be under
...
