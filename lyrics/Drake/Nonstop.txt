Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

Look, I just flipped a switch (flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop (ayy, hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (give me my respect)
I just took it left like I'm Ambidex'
Bitch, I move through London with the Euro step
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm goin' (outta there, I'm gone)
How I go from six to twenty-three like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (ayy, servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap (ayy)
Funny how they shook (ayy, got these niggas shook)
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I'm a hard hitta
Yeah, I'm light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm a unforgivin' wild-ass dog, nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a grave digger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again
