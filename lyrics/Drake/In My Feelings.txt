Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yup

Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin' out of options
'Cause I've been going off and they don't know when it's stopping

And when you get to topping
I see that you've been learning
And when I take you shopping
 you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it

I buy you Champagne but you love some Henny
From the block, like you Jenny
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many

'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
