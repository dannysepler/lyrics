Don't you know I'm no good for you
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
But nothin' ever stops you leaving

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
