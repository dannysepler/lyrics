Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say

Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell

If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
...
