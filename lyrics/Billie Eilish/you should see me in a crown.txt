Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine

Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow one by, one by, one
One by, one byâ€“
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow one by, one by, one
One by, one by (one)
