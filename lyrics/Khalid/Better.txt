(Nothing feels better)
("I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up")
("I'm not, I'm so sober!")

I love to see you shine in the night
Like the diamond you are
(I love to see you shine in the night)
(Like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright
Just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright)
(Just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do
Hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do)
(Hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street, so we meet
When you need it, it's yours
All I hear is...

Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
...
