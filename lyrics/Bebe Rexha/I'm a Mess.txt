Everything's been so messed up here lately
Pretty sure he don't wanna be my baby
Ohh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me, but that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me, yeah, I love myself anyway, hey

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good, good life
That's what my therapists say
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess, for your love
It ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love
It ain't new
