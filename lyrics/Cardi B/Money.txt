Look, my bitches all bad, my niggas all real
I ride his dick, and some big tall hills
Big fat checks, big large bills
Front, I'll flip like ten cartwheels
Cold ass bitch, I give Ross chills
Ten different looks and my looks all kill
I kiss him in the mouth, I feel all grills
He eat in the car, that's meals on wheels (Woo!)

I was born to flex (Yes!)
Diamonds on my neck
I like boardin' jets, I like mornin' sex (Woo!)
But nothing in this world
That I like more than checks

(Money)
All I really wanna see is the
(Money)
I don't really need the D, I need the
(Money)
All a bad bitch need is the
(Money)

I got bands in the coupe (Coupe!)
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe (Coupe!)
Touch me, I'll shoot (Bow!)

Shake a little ass
(Money)
To get a little bag and take it to the store
(Money)
Get a little cash
(Money)
You shake it real fast, you get a little more
(Money)

I got bands in the coupe (Coupe!)
Bustin' out the roof
I got bands in the coupe (Brrr)
Bustin' out the roof

I gotta fly, I need a jet, shit
I need room for my legs
