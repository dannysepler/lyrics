It's Cardi, ayy
Said, "I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to"

Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who?
Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much
I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes,
Don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, "Goals,"
Bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo
I might just feel on your babe,
