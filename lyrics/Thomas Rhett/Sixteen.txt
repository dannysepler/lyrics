Uh uh
Take a left here boy, take it slow
Don't get distracted by that radio
I just rolled my eyes and I said: Daddy, I know
I'm 15, I ain't green like some old ten year old

What I wouldn't give to be sixteen, wild and free?
Cruising up and down main in my F-150
Roll the windows down, bass too loud from this burnt CD
I'll be right where I wanna be when I'm 16
16, yeah
16

Now that I can drive, finally feel alive, but I got this curfew
Sneaking in late, smelling like my girlfriend's perfume
...
