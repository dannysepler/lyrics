Don't waste your life behind that guitar
You may get gone, but you won't get far
You're not the first, you won't be the last
And you can tell us all about it when you come crawling back
That road you're on, just winds and winds
Your spinning your wheels and wasting you're time

But when the lights come up
And I hear the band
And where they said I'd never be is exactly where I am
I hear the crowd
I look around
And I can't find an empty chair
...
